# College Event Website (CEW)
Full-stack project made for COP 4710, demonstrating understanding of relational database design with SQL. The website is a CRUD program that deals with events for a college with attributes such as location and time. Access levels are considered between the Student user, Admin user, and Superadmin user.

## Design Report
The **COP4710_ProjectReport.pdf** file breaks down the specifications of the project, including the Entity-Relation Model and the implementation of constraints.
